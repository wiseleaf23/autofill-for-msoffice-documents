#### Device configuration
* Set trusted locations for the template files (https://github.com/wiseleaf23/microsoft-device-management/tree/master/Microsoft%20Office%20client%20apps)
* Exclude the location that contains the template files via Windows Defender, or sign the template files (signing has not been tested yet)

### For end-users
Please note the following:
* Autofill will only work the first time you open a document from the template
* The first time you open a template with autofill, you could get a warning about the code that is contained in the document. You should mark this document as trusted, but always be careful about which document to mark as trusted!
* The first time it runs will take a longer time because components will be installed, depending on the speed of your computer and your internet it should take about 20 seconds
* After the first run, autofill should take no more than 5 seconds
* You need to have a working internet connection
